## 🏗️ Data Architecture Overview

This project uses the **Medallion Architecture**, which organizes data into three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   - Raw data ingested from CSV files  
   - Stored in SQL Server without transformation

2. **Silver Layer**  
   - Cleansed and standardized data  
   - Includes normalization and business logic

3. **Gold Layer**  
   - Final analytical layer  
   - Star schema with dimension and fact views for reporting
